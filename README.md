This project was abandoned by me a couple of years ago. Fundamental security issues in the generation of private keys have been brought to my attention. See: https://github.com/johguse/profanity/issues/61

I strongly advice against using this tool in its current state. This repository will soon be further updated with additional information regarding this critical issue.
